# Socket-Programming
This python program allows for two instances of the applications to communicate, passing an instance of a file to one another.
The program allows for one instance to act as the sever, while the other acts as the client.
The Server will hold a file or folder of information that the server will send to the client.
Once the transaction has been made there will be a notification to the client that the file has been transfered. 
After transfer the file will be accessible from the other instance.
